(Abstract)

In the years immediately following the death of St. Thomas Aquinas (1274),
the opposition his philosophy met during his lifetime continued and even in-
creased. There was a flowering ot‘ anti-Thoinist literaturev which tried to show
that he had fallen into error and even contradicted himself. William de la Mare's
Correctorimn of St. Thomas is one of the most noteworthy treatises written in
this spirit. In reply, the follow-ers of St. Thomas defended the truth and con-

sistency of their master's teaching. At 1116 531116 time, they wished to facilitate ‘

the study of 1115 voluminous writings‚ and to this end they made numerous
“abbreviations” and “tables'’ which served as convenient summaries of his
thought.

The Coucordanlia Veritatis, the subject of the present thesis, must be under-
stood against this historical background. The treatise was written sometime
between 1280 and 1323, probably in the last decade of the 13th century, It has
been attributed to both Thomas of Sutton and Benedict of Assignano, but for
doctrinal and chronological reasons these attributions are doubtful. What is
certain is that the author was a partisan of Thornism who wished to reply to
those who claimed that his master contradicted himself in his many writings.
The work is made up of 101 articles; each reconciles several seemingly contra-
dictory statements of St. Thomas on one point of doctrine. The method of the
anonymous Concordator is the same in each case. He first states the seeming
contradiction, and then, by use of Abelardian and other scholastic techniques,
he eliminates the difficulty. His subject matter and many of his solutions indicate
that his work is related to an earlier concordance, the concordantia Pertransi-
bunt.

Since, with the exception of the Introduction, the Concordantia Veritatis
exists only in manuscript form. it was first necessary to make an edition of it.
In preparing the edition, five of the six known manuscripts were used. Owing
to its great length. only 51 articles are included in the present thesis, and the
analysis ot them has been limited to six. The articles thus chosen show the
ῃέιῖιπε of the work. and the method. source material and philosophical mentality
o its author.

In one article. it is claimed that St. Thomas offered several contradictory
statements in discussing his theory of knowledge: in one place. he says that the
act by which I know a thing and the act by which Ι know that knowledge are
the same: in another place. he says that these acts are different. The Concordator
accepts the opponents' statement of the difficulty and resolves it by pointing out
St. Thomas’ meaning, namely. that these acts of the intellect differ as to their
object. but not as 10 their subject. An examination of St. Thomas' texts show
that his opponents have misquoted him. What he actually says is that the enjoy-
ment of the end and the enjoyment of the act performed with 3 view to the end
are subjective& one. just as the knowledge of a thing and the knowledge of
that knowledge are subjectively one. On the other hand, Thomas asserts that the
