object known iu the knowledge of a stone and the object known in the knowledge
of that knowledge are objectiva-ly different. Thus, the concordatur has solved
the difficulty by making a truly 'l'homistic distinction, although he is too willing
to accept his opponents' statement of the problmu, and he does not show an
appreciation of the point at issue in St. 'l'honias' own texts.

One of the main philosophica! controversies after St. 'l‘homas' death revolved
on the meaning he attached to existence (csse). The Concordantia Veritatis
is a witness to this dispute, for in it, Thonnas' opposition claims that he contra-
dicted himselt ln one text, he asserted that existence is not an accident of
essence, while in another, in speaking of the being of the angels, he said that
existence is an accident.

The Concordator attempts to reconcile the contradiction in three ways. First,
lte says that existence is not an accident if by existence is meant the principle of
being. Similarly, whiteness is not accidental if by it is meant the principle of
being white, for whiteness is essentially the principle of being white. So too,
existence is essentially the principle of being. On thr: other hand, in reference
to substance, existence is an accident, as whiteness is an accident of substance.
Secondly, the Concordator asserts that existence, essence and being are logically
distinct. Existence, then, is really identical with essence. and in itself it cannot
be an accident. However, it signifies essence or being as an “emergent act”‚ and
accordingly it is accidental in its mode or signification. Thirdly, existence.
insofar as it belongs to substance, is reduced to the category of substance, and
thus it is not an accident. As related, however, to a supposit. it is an accident,
for a supposit has existence only through form. lixistenee stands in the same
relation to supposit as rational does to animal.

Reference to St. Thomas’ texts is strikingly absent from this attempted
reconciliation of the original contradictory statements. The Concordator ignores
Thomas' explanation of the sense in which csse is and is not an accident. Further-
more, in affirming a merely logical distinction between existence and essence,
the Concordator niisinterprets a very fundamental point in his master's

hiloso h .

p St. 'Iphg'mag’ opponents found another seeming contradiction in his use of the
term “subJect of a science'’. They affirm that Thomas sometimes calls God the
subject of theology‚ while at other times he says that its subject is the divine
being knowable by inspiration (by which they mean, in the Concordator's report,
at least, the whole content of Revelation). The Concordator reconciles these
views by distinguishing between two notions of the subject of a science. A
science has a primary subJect, and in the case of theology this is the divine
being knowable by inspiration. sor that embraces all that one can predicate of
God as He is known through Revelation. But there is a primary and proper
subject of a scieuce, and in this case, it is God: this subject includes all that
can be attributed to God as He is known through Revelation.

An investigation of St. Thomas' texts in their chronological order reveals
that the Concordator's solution is a rather facile one. He does not take into
account the different problems considered by St. Thomas in his various dis-
cussions of this point. He fails to see the implied correction of Thomas’ earlier
view of the subject of theology in the answer Thomas gives in his Smnma
Theoloyiae.

A question is raised concerning St. Thomas' views on the authorship of the
Dc· Spiritu et Anima. It is said that at one time he attributes the book to St.
Angustiae and at another time to a Cistercian. This is a misrepresentation of
St. Thomas⁷ statements. for in one of them he simply attributes a certain phrase
in the De Spiritu c! Anima to Augustino, and in the other he reports the opinion
that the book was written by a Cistercian. The Concordator disregards the
exact tenor of St. Thomas' words and solves the difficulty in his own way. He
says that St. Thomas' two statements represent a change of opinion regarding
the authorship of the work.
