A further seeming contradiction is found in St. Thomas' doctrine οἱ the
divine attributes. It is claimed that, according to him, the plurality oi these
attributes arises from God’s essence and not {rom our knowledge of it. Else-
where, however, he says that these attributes are in God in a simple, unified
way. Actually, these statements are torn out of their context. St. Thomas' words
do not present any difficulty when they are read in his own works. The Con-
cordator does not attempt to explain the context in which they appear⁴ Yet he
quite correctly explains St, Thomas⁷ position: objectiva-tr, as we know God,
there is a plurality of divine attributes, since our intellects represent the simple
as manifold; subjectively. in God Himself, there is no plurality.

In resolving the contradictions which the anti-Thornists found in the writings
of St. Thomas, the anonymous author of the Concordantin Veritatis generally
accepts their statement of the difficulty. It matters little to him that St. Thomas’
words are ordinarily taken out of their context. He does not attempt to under-
stand that context. He never re-phrases his opponents' statement oi the problem.
Rather. he treats each as a genuine difficulty and offers a resolution by appealing
to St. Thomas* texts as well as to contemporary and patristic writings. Occasion-
ally‚ he reveals his misconception of St. Thomas· true doctrine. As a result, his
treatise is an important aid in estimating the impact of Thomism upon the late
thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries.
