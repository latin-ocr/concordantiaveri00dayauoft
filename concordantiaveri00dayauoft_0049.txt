bonitate to say that these sswo texts belong bo a common
group· On the bas1s of present 1nr0rmat10n, none or the
manuaor1pts seems to be tho apograph. Bethor, there seem
to be three 1ndependent ”groups” of manuscr1pta der1ved rrum
a common and unknown first manu-or1pt. There are tvo early
trad1t1ona‚ 10e.‚ F and v, and one later one - PU (or UP)1

ference 1n this ed1t1on. When an exhaust1ve search for the
manuner1pts 1³ eomplet0d‚ a cr1t1oa1 ed1t10n of thsss concord-
anee ean be pub11shed3 at that time, some more oonolus1ve
data aa to possible manuaor1pt group2ngs ror el1n1nat10n or
varssants ln the ed1t1on can be presented. S1noe the nature

where the sense os the treatzse so demanded, and to 1n01ud0
the varssants of all manuscripts used ln th1s ed1t10n 1n the
paleograph10a1 notes. This should ra0111nate the work of the
cr1t1oa1 ed1ss0r wh11e a1lo=1ng the reader of thsss ed1t1on to
